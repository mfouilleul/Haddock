# Haddock
CLI tools for tracking your Sailaway voyages, or connecting them to external charting/routing applications via NMEA.

## HADDOCK

Queries the Sailaway servers for information on your boats, and logs their position and other relevant information to a locally-stored log.

You can:
- browse your logbooks
- plot your boats' position using OpenSeaMap or EarthWindMap
- send NMEA sentences from one boat to an external charting application like [qtVlm](https://www.meltemus.com/index.php/en/) or [OpenCPN](https://opencpn.org/), via a TCP server.

While running, the application will automatically update every 10 minutes.

```
usage: haddock [<port number>]

OPTIONAL: <port number> specifies the port number for the NMEA TCP server (11010 by default).

```

## NMEA

The NMEA server only. Select one of your boats to start a TCP server and send NMEA sentences to an external charting application. (The server will also continue to update your logbooks in the background.)

```
usage: nmea [<port number>] [<boat number>]

OPTIONAL: <port number> specifies the port number for the NMEA TCP server (11010 by default).

OPTIONAL: <boat number> specifies the boat number for which to immediately launch a NMEA server.
```
